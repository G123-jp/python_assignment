# Take-Home Assignment
1
The goal of this take-home assignment is to evaluate your abilities to use API, data processing and transformation, SQL, and implement a new API service in Python.

You should first fork this repository, and then send us the code or the url of your forked repository via email.

**Please do not submit any pull requests to this repository.**

You need to perform the following **Two** tasks:

## Task1
### Problem Statement:
1. Retrieve the financial data of Two given stocks (IBM, Apple Inc.)for the most recently two weeks. Please using an free API provider named [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) 
2. Process the raw API data response, a sample output after process should be like:
```
{
    "symbol": "IBM",
    "date": "2023-02-14",
    "open_price": "153.08",
    "close_price": "154.52",
    "volume": "62199013",
},
{
    "symbol": "IBM",
    "date": "2023-02-13",
    "open_price": "153.08",
    "close_price": "154.52",
    "volume": "59099013"
},
{
    "symbol": "IBM",
    "date": "2023-02-12",
    "open_price": "153.08",
    "close_price": "154.52",
    "volume": "42399013"
},
...
``` 
3. Insert the records above into a table named `financial_data` in your local database, column name should be same as the processed data from step 2 above (symbol, date, open_price, close_price, volume) 


## Task2
### Problem Statement:
1. Implement an Get financial_data API to retrieve records from `financial_data` table, please note that:
    - the endpoint should accept following parameters: start_date, end_date, symbol, all parameters are optional
    - the endpoint should support pagination with parameter: limit and page, if no parameters are given, default limit for one page is 5
    - the endpoint should return an result with three properties:
        - data: an array includes actual results
        - pagination: handle pagination with four properties
            
            - count: count of all records without panigation
            - page: current page index
            - limit: limit of records can be retrieved for single page
            - pages: total number of pages
        - info: includes any error info if applies
    

Sample Request:
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/financial_data?start_date=2023-01-01&end_date=2023-01-14&symbol=IBM&limit=3&page=2'

```
Sample Response:
```
{
    "data": [
        {
            "symbol": "IBM",
            "date": "2023-01-05",
            "open_price": "153.08",
            "close_price": "154.52",
            "volume": "62199013",
        },
        {
            "symbol": "IBM",
            "date": "2023-01-06",
            "open_price": "153.08",
            "close_price": "154.52",
            "volume": "59099013"
        },
        {
            "symbol": "IBM",
            "date": "2023-01-09",
            "open_price": "153.08",
            "close_price": "154.52",
            "volume": "42399013"
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "count": 20,
        "page": 2,
        "limit": 3,
        "pages": 7
    },
    "info": {'error': ''}
}

```

2. Implement an Get statistics API to perform the following calculations on the data in given period of time:
    - Calculate the average daily open price for the period
    - Calculate the average daily closing price for the period
    - Calculate the average daily volume for the period

    - the endpoint should accept following parameters: start_date, end_date, symbols, all parameters are required
    - the endpoint should return an result with two properties:
        - data: calculated statistic results
        - info: includes any error info if applies

Sample request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/statistics?start_date=2023-01-01&end_date=2023-01-31&symbol=IBM

```
Sample response:
```
{
    "data": {
        "start_date": "2023-01-01",
        "end_date": "2023-01-31",
        "symbol": "IBM",
        "average_daily_open_price": 123.45,
        "average_daily_close_price": 234.56,
        "average_daily_volume": 1000000
    },
    "info": {'error': ''}
}

```

## What you should deliver:
Directory structure:
```
project-name/
├── model.py
├── schema.sql
├── get_raw_data.py
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── financial/<Include API service code here>

```

1. A `get_raw_data.py` file in root folder

    Action: 
    
    Run 
    ```bash
    python get_raw_data.py
    ```

    Expectation: 
    
    1. Financial data will be retrieved from API and processed,then insert all processed records into table `financial_data` in local db
    2. Duplicated records should be avoided when executing get_raw_data multiple times, consider implementing your own logic to perform upsert operation if the database you select does not have native support for such operation.

2. A `schema.sql` file in root folder
    
    Define schema for financial_data table, if you prefer to use an ORM library, just **ignore** this deliver item and jump to item3 below.

    Action: Run schema definition in local db

    Expectation: A new table named `financial_data` should be created if not exists in db

3. (Optional) A `model.py` file: 
    
    If you perfer to use a ORM library instead of DDL, please include your model definition in `model.py`, and describe how to perform migration in README.md file

4. A `Dockerfile` file in root folder

    Build up your local API service

5. A `docker-compose.yml` file in root folder

    Two services should be defined in docker-compose.yml: Database and your API

    Action:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    Expectation:
    Both database and your API service is up and running in local development environment

6. A `financial` sub-folder:

    Put all API implementation related codes in here

7. `README.md`: 

    You should include:
    - A brief project description
    - Tech stack you are using in this project
    - How to run your code in local environment
    - Provide a description of how to maintain the API key to retrieve financial data from AlphaVantage in both local development and production environment.

8. A `requirements.txt` file:

    It should contain your dependency libraries.

## Requirements:

- The program should be written in Python 3.
- You are free to use any API and libraries you like, but should include a brief explanation of why you chose the API and libraries you used in README.
- The API key to retrieve financial data should be stored securely. Please provide a description of how to maintain the API key from both local development and production environment in README.
- The database in Problem Statement 1 could be created using SQLite/MySQL/.. with your own choice.
- The program should include error handling to handle cases where the API returns an error or the data is not in the correct format.
- The program should cover as many edge cases as possible, not limited to expectations from deliverable above.
- The program should use appropriate data structures and algorithms to store the data and perform the calculations.
- The program should include appropriate documentation, including docstrings and inline comments to explain the code.

## Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: Does the program produce the correct results?
- Code quality: Is the code well-structured, easy to read, and maintainable?
- Design: Does the program make good use of functions, data structures, algorithms, databases, and libraries?
- Error handling: Does the program handle errors and unexpected input appropriately?
- Documentation: Is the code adequately documented, with clear explanations of the algorithms and data structures used?

## Additional Notes:

You have 7 days to complete this assignment and submit your solution.
